# Computing the Area of a 3-Dimensional Rectangle (Cuboid)

In three-dimensional space, a "rectangle" is typically referred to as a **cuboid**. A cuboid is a 3D shape with six rectangular faces, and to find the area (more precisely, the surface area) of a cuboid, we need to calculate the areas of each face and sum them up.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. **Understanding the Shape**

A cuboid has three dimensions:
- **Length (l)**: the longest side.
- **Width (w)**: the side perpendicular to the length.
- **Height (h)**: the vertical side.

These three dimensions define the size of the cuboid.

### 2. **Area of a Rectangle**

The **area of a rectangle** is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
\]

This formula gives the area of one rectangular face of the cuboid.

### 3. **Surface Area of the Cuboid**

The **surface area** of a cuboid is the total area of all six rectangular faces. A cuboid has three distinct pairs of opposite faces:
- Two faces with area \( l \times w \)
- Two faces with area \( l \times h \)
- Two faces with area \( w \times h \)

The total surface area \( A \) is the sum of the areas of all six faces:

\[
A = 2(lw + lh + wh)
\]

Here:
- \( 2(lw) \) is for the two faces with length and width.
- \( 2(lh) \) is for the two faces with length and height.
- \( 2(wh) \) is for the two faces with width and height.

### 4. **Final Formula for Surface Area**

The formula to compute the surface area \( A \) of a cuboid is:

\[
A = 2(lw + lh + wh)
\]

This formula gives the total area of all six faces of the cuboid.

## Example

Let’s say we have a cuboid with:
- Length \( l = 4 \) units
- Width \( w = 3 \) units
- Height \( h = 5 \) units

We can plug these values into the formula for surface area:

\[
A = 2(4 \times 3 + 4 \times 5 + 3 \times 5)
\]

\[
A = 2(12 + 20 + 15) = 2 \times 47 = 94 \text{ square units}
\]

So, the surface area of this cuboid is 94 square units.

## Key Concepts

- **Rectangle Area**: The area of a flat, two-dimensional shape with four right angles. It is calculated by multiplying the length and the width.
  
- **Surface Area**: The total area of all the faces of a 3D object. For a cuboid, it’s the sum of the areas of the six rectangular faces.
  
- **Dimensions**: These are the three measurements (length, width, height) that define the size of the cuboid.

By using simple multiplication and addition, you can easily compute the surface area of any cuboid.
